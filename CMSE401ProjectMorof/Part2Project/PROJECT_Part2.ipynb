    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrency markets are a rapidly evolving domain within finance and economics, characterized by extreme volatility, global trading, and large datasets updated in real-time. This project focuses on the computational challenges associated with **real-time cryptocurrency portfolio valuation** — specifically fetching live asset prices and calculating portfolio worth. The motivation for selecting this domain stems from the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in modern finance and the natural opportunity it provides for studying parallel programming techniques applied to financial data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I built software to **evaluate a cryptocurrency portfolio** by fetching current asset prices from the **CoinMarketCap (CMC) API**. Two approaches were implemented and compared: a **serial method**, where prices are retrieved one at a time, and a **parallel (asynchronous) method**, where multiple price requests are handled concurrently. Using Python's `requests`, `aiohttp`, and `asyncio` libraries, I benchmarked both approaches across different portfolio sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results showed that while the parallel method introduced some efficiency improvements, the free CoinMarketCap API’s rate limits and server-side processing constraints limited the full potential of asynchronous performance. Nevertheless, the project successfully demonstrated how parallel programming can optimize computational tasks that involve large-scale external data fetching, with especially promising improvements observable as portfolio size increased.  \n"

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved building and benchmarking a cryptocurrency portfolio valuation tool that fetches live price data using the CoinMarketCap (CMC) API. The main goal was to measure the performance difference between a **serial (one-by-one)** API fetching method and a **parallel (asynchronous)** fetching method using Python's `asyncio` and `aiohttp` libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reproduce this project, follow these detailed steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install required Python packages:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install requests aiohttp python-dotenv matplotlib pandas\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a `.env` file in the project directory to securely store your CoinMarketCap API key:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  CMC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain a free API key by creating an account at [https://coinmarketcap.com/api/](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Basic Portfolio Valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The files `basic_portfolio.txt`, `portfolio_serial.py`, and `portfolio_parallel.py` allow for simple testing.\n",
    "- `basic_portfolio.txt` defines a small cryptocurrency portfolio with fixed assets and amounts.\n",
    "- `portfolio_serial.py`:\n",
    "  - Reads `basic_portfolio.txt`.\n",
    "  - Fetches prices serially using Python's `requests` library.\n",
    "  - Prints out the value of each holding and the total portfolio value.\n",
    "- `portfolio_parallel.py`:\n",
    "  - Reads the same `basic_portfolio.txt`.\n",
    "  - Fetches prices in parallel using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`.\n",
    "  - Prints out the value of each holding and the total portfolio value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Benchmarking Valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The benchmarking section of the project uses larger, predefined portfolios found in `portfolios.txt`.\n",
    "- `portfolios.txt` contains portfolios of 3, 5, 8, and 12 assets, manually defined with realistic holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benchmark Scripts:**\n",
    "- `benchmark_serial.py`:\n",
    "  - Loads each portfolio from `portfolios.txt`.\n",
    "  - Fetches prices serially.\n",
    "  - Times the total duration for valuing each portfolio.\n",
    "  - Plots the timing results.\n",
    "  - Saves raw timing data to `serial_benchmark_results.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `benchmark_parallel.py`:\n",
    "  - Loads the same portfolios.\n",
    "  - Fetches prices in parallel using async programming.\n",
    "  - Times the total duration for each valuation.\n",
    "  - Plots timing results.\n",
    "  - Saves raw timing data to `parallel_benchmark_results.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both scripts also output:\n",
    "- Total portfolio values.\n",
    "- Individual holding breakdowns (amounts × prices = values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Performance Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compare_serial_parallel.py`:\n",
    "  - Reads the CSV files generated from serial and parallel benchmarks.\n",
    "  - Creates two plots:\n",
    "    - **Serial vs Parallel Timing** comparison (`serial_vs_parallel_timing.png`).\n",
    "    - **Speedup Factor** plot showing how much faster parallel valuation was (`speedup_factor.png`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Notes About the API and System Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- CoinMarketCap Free API Plan:\n",
    "  - Limited to 30 requests per minute.\n",
    "  - Portfolios were designed carefully to stay under this limit by testing reasonable asset counts.\n",
    "- Some inconsistencies in speedup results are expected due to server-side API rate handling and response times.\n",
    "- All scripts are designed to run sequentially and independently for clear benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these instructions and the provided files, a future student should be able to reproduce all results, regenerate the timing graphs, and build upon the project further if desired."

    "\n",
    "This section presents the performance benchmarking results comparing the serial and parallel approaches for cryptocurrency portfolio valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Description\n",
    "\n",
    "All tests were conducted on a **MacBook Pro** with the following specifications:\n",
    "- Model: MacBookPro16,2\n",
    "- Processor: Quad-Core Intel Core i5 @ 2.0 GHz\n",
    "- Number of Cores: 4\n",
    "- Memory: 16 GB RAM\n",
    "- Operating System: macOS Monterey\n",
    "- Python Version: 3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the CoinMarketCap API server-side speed and public network conditions can affect the benchmark timing in addition to the local hardware setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline Serial Timing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial version of the project (`benchmark_serial.py`) fetched cryptocurrency prices one-by-one using blocking `requests` calls.  \n",
    "The total time taken for valuing each portfolio size was recorded and plotted.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimized Parallel Timing Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The parallel version (`benchmark_parallel.py`) used `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to asynchronously fetch all cryptocurrency prices simultaneously.  \n",
    "The goal was to reduce total valuation time by overlapping waiting periods during network calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"benchmark_parallel_results.png\" alt=\"Parallel Timing Results\" width=\"60%\">\n",

    "## Direct Comparison of Serial vs Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph compares the timing results for the serial and parallel versions side-by-side:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"serial_vs_parallel_timing.png\" alt=\"Serial vs Parallel Timing Comparison\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The parallel method consistently performed slightly faster than the serial method, particularly as the number of assets increased. However, the speedup was not as dramatic as might be expected from full asynchronous parallelism. This behavior can be attributed to limitations imposed by the CoinMarketCap Free API, such as server-side processing delays and API throttling, which constrained the effectiveness of client-side optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Speedup Factor Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the performance difference, a speedup factor was calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Speedup} = \\frac{\\text{Serial Time}}{\\text{Parallel Time}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph shows the speedup factor achieved at each portfolio size:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"speedup_factor.png\" alt=\"Speedup Factor Graph\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While a small speedup is consistently observed, the factor remained close to 1.0 for most portfolio sizes.  \n",
    "This confirms that the bottleneck is primarily on the server-side rather than the client-side fetch performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results partially met expectations.  \n",
    "Parallel fetching using asynchronous programming did reduce total valuation times slightly, especially for larger portfolios. However, full potential performance gains were limited by external API constraints beyond the code's control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably:\n",
    "- **Small portfolios (3-5 assets)** showed very minimal timing differences.\n",
    "- **Larger portfolios (8-12 assets)** showed slightly more pronounced parallel advantages.\n",
    "- The **CoinMarketCap Free API** likely serialized or delayed responses internally, masking the true benefits of parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the parallel method proved to be a cleaner and more scalable structure, even if network and server-side limitations muted raw performance gains.\n",

    "# Concluding Discussion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored the challenge of **real-time cryptocurrency portfolio valuation** by fetching live data from the CoinMarketCap API and comparing the performance of **serial** versus **parallel (asynchronous)** data fetching techniques. Two systems were developed — one based on traditional blocking `requests`, and one based on asynchronous programming using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`. A benchmarking study was conducted using portfolios of increasing size to measure and compare the performance of both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final results showed that while the **parallel method consistently outperformed the serial approach**, the speedup was not as large as initially expected. The limited performance gains were primarily attributed to external factors such as **CoinMarketCap API server response times**, **rate limiting**, and **public network variability**. Nevertheless, the project clearly demonstrated the potential of **asynchronous programming** to optimize tasks involving multiple I/O-bound network operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:\n",
    "- Building reproducible benchmarking experiments.\n",
    "- Using Python's asynchronous tools (`asyncio`, `aiohttp`) effectively.\n",
    "- Understanding the real-world limitations of parallel programming when external systems (like public APIs) introduce bottlenecks.\n",
    "- Structuring projects for clean reproducibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work** could involve:\n",
    "- Testing against a **locally hosted server** or **faster commercial APIs** to better demonstrate full asynchronous advantages.\n",
    "- **Batching API requests** when permitted to reduce network overhead.\n",
    "- Expanding the project to include **historical portfolio tracking** over time.\n",
    "- Adding **error recovery and retries** for failed API requests to further improve reliability.\n",
    "- Deploying the system into a **real-time dashboard** for continuous portfolio monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project provided a strong, practical understanding of both cryptocurrency data handling and performance optimization techniques in Python."
